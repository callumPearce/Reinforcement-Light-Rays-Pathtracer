\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{chap:conclusion}

{\bf A compulsory chapter,     of roughly $5$ pages} 
\vspace{1cm} 

\noindent
The concluding chapter of a dissertation is often underutilised because it 
is too often left too close to the deadline: it is important to allocation
enough attention.  Ideally, the chapter will consist of three parts:

\begin{enumerate}
\item (Re)summarise the main contributions and achievements, in essence
      summing up the content.
\item Clearly state the current project status (e.g., ``X is working, Y 
      is not'') and evaluate what has been achieved with respect to the 
      initial aims and objectives (e.g., ``I completed aim X outlined 
      previously, the evidence for this is within Chapter Y'').  There 
      is no problem including aims which were not completed, but it is 
      important to evaluate and/or justify why this is the case.
\item Outline any open problems or future plans.  Rather than treat this
      only as an exercise in what you {\em could} have done given more 
      time, try to focus on any unexplored options or interesting outcomes
      (e.g., ``my experiment for X gave counter-intuitive results, this 
      could be because Y and would form an interesting area for further 
      study'' or ``users found feature Z of my software difficult to use,
      which is obvious in hindsight but not during at design stage; to 
      resolve this, I could clearly apply the technique of Smith [7]'').
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Plan}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Summarise contributions:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Research into hwo neural network architectures relate to learning the irradiance distribution for a scene with a specific type of geometry

\item Implementing a path tracer from scratch to analyse in depth the difficulties and issues that come with Ken Dahm's algorithm. Including memory usage, parallelisation and parameter usage.

\item Analysis of different reinforcement learning approaches pitched together clearly on a variety of scenes

\item Analysis of neural networks ability to learn the irradiance distribution function

\item Online deep-reinforcement learning algorithms effectiveness of learning irradiance distribution function
\end{enumerate}

\item If DQN does not work well provide some further analysis on potential other alternatives which could be used.

\item Future Work: Policy learning to model continuous action \& state space

\item DDQN and other deep reinforcement learning strategies
\end{enumerate}
