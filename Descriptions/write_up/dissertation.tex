% =============================================================================

% This section simply introduces the structural guidelines.  It can clearly
% be deleted (or commented out) if you use the file as a template for your
% own dissertation: everything following it is in the correct order to use 
% as is.

\section*{Prelude}
\thispagestyle{empty}

A typical dissertation will be structured according to (somewhat) standard 
sections, described in what follows.  However, it is hard and perhaps even 
counter-productive to generalise: the goal is {\em not} to be prescriptive, 
but simply to act as a guideline.  In particular, each page count given is
important but {\em not} absolute: their aim is simply to highlight that a 
clear, concise description is better than a rambling alternative that makes
it hard to separate important content and facts from trivia.

You can use this document as a \LaTeX-based~\cite{latexbook1,latexbook2} 
template for your own dissertation by simply deleting extraneous sections
and content; keep in mind that the associated {\tt Makefile} could be of
use, in particular because it automatically executes  to 
deal with the associated bibliography.  

You can, on the other hand, opt {\em not} to use this template; this is a 
perfectly acceptable approach.  Note that a standard cover and declaration 
of authorship may still be produced online via
\[
\mbox{\url{http://www.cs.bris.ac.uk/Teaching/Resources/cover.html}}
\]

% =============================================================================

% This macro creates the standard UoB title page by using information drawn
% from the document class (meaning it is vital you select the correct degree 
% title and so on).

\maketitle

% After the title page (which is a special case in that it is not numbered)
% comes the front matter or preliminaries; this macro signals the start of
% such content, meaning the pages are numbered with Roman numerals.

\frontmatter

% This macro creates the standard UoB declaration; on the printed hard-copy,
% this must be physically signed by the author in the space indicated.

\makedecl

% LaTeX automatically generates a table of contents, plus associated lists 
% of figures, tables and algorithms.  The former is a compulsory part of the
% dissertation, but if you do not require the latter they can be suppressed
% by simply commenting out the associated macro.

\tableofcontents
\listoffigures
\listoftables
\listofalgorithms
\lstlistoflistings

% The following sections are part of the front matter, but are not generated
% automatically by LaTeX; the use of \chapter* means they are not numbered.

% -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

\subfile{chapters/executive_summary}

\subfile{chapters/supporting_technologies}

\subfile{chapters/notation_acronyms}

\subfile{chapters/acknowledgements}

% =============================================================================

% After the front matter comes a number of chapters; under each chapter,
% sections, subsections and even subsubsections are permissible.  The
% pages in this part are numbered with Arabic numerals.  Note that:
%
% - A reference point can be marked using \label{XXX}, and then later
%   referred to via \ref{XXX}; for example Chapter\ref{chap:context}.
% - The chapters are presented here in one file; this can become hard
%   to manage.  An alternative is to save the content in seprate files
%   the use \input{XXX} to import it, which acts like the #include
%   directive in C.

\mainmatter

\subfile{chapters/1_conceptual_background}

\subfile{chapters/2_technical_background}

\subfile{chapters/3_td_learning_methods_for_light_transport}

\subfile{chapters/4_critical_evaluation}

\subfile{chapters/5_conclusion}
% =============================================================================

% Finally, after the main matter, the back matter is specified.  This is
% typically populated with just the bibliography.  LaTeX deals with these
% in one of two ways, namely
%
% - inline, which roughly means the author specifies entries using the 
%   \bibitem macro and typesets them manually, or
% - using BiBTeX, which means entries are contained in a separate file
%   (which is essentially a databased) then inported; this is the 
%   approach used below, with the databased being dissertation.bib.
%
% Either way, the each entry has a key (or identifier) which can be used
% in the main matter to cite it, e.g., \cite{X}, \cite[Chapter 2}{Y}.

\backmatter

\bibliography{dissertation}

% -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

% The dissertation concludes with a set of (optional) appendicies; these are 
% the same as chapters in a sense, but once signaled as being appendicies via
% the associated macro, LaTeX manages them appropriatly.

\appendix

\chapter{An Example Appendix}
\label{appx:example}

Content which is not central to, but may enhance the dissertation can be 
included in one or more appendices; examples include, but are not limited
to

\begin{itemize}
\item lengthy mathematical proofs, numerical or graphical results which 
      are summarised in the main body,
\item sample or example calculations, 
      and
\item results of user studies or questionnaires.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
Note that in line with most research conferences, the marking panel is not
obliged to read such appendices.
